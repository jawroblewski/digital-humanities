<lb rend="indent">But what after all is one night? A short space,</lb>
<lb>especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so</lb>  
<lb>soon a bird sings , a cock crows, or a faint green</lb> 
<lb>quickns, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of a</lb>  
<lb>wave. Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter</lb>  
<lb>holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally,</lb> 
<lb>evenly, with indefatigable fingers. They lengthen;</lb> 
<lb>they darken. Some of them hold aloft clear planets,</lb> 
<lb>plates of brightness. The autumn trees, ravaged as</lb> 
<lb>they are, take on the flash of tattered flags kindling</lb> 
<lb>in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold</lb>  
<lb>letters on marble pages describe death in battle and</lb> 
<lb>how bones bleach and burn far away in <place><country>Indian</country></place></lb>  
<lb>sands. The autumn tres gleam in the yellow moon-</lb> 
<lb>light, in the light of harvest moons, the light which</lb> 
<lb>mellows the energy of labour and smooths the</lb> 
<lb>stubble, and brings the wave lapping blue to the</lb> 
<lb>shore.</lb>

<lb rend="indent">It seemed now as if, touch by human penitence</lb> 
<lb>and all its toil, divine goodness had parted the cur-</lb> 
<lb>tain and displayed behind it, single, distinct, the</lb> 
<lb>hare erect; the wave falling; the boat rocking;</lb> 
<fw place="bottom rend=align(leftindent)" type="pageNum">192</fw>
<pb="192">
<fw place="top" rend="align(center) case(allcaps)">Time Passes</fw>
<lb> which, did we deserve them, should be ours always.</lb> 
<lb>But alas, divine goodness, twitiching the cord, draws</lb> 
<lb>the curtain; it does not please him; he covers his</lb>  
<lb>treasures in a drench of hail, and so breaks them,</lb> 
<lb>so confuses them that it seems impossible that their</lb> 
<lb>calm should ever return or that we should ever com-</lb> 
<lb>pose from their fragments a perfect whole or read</lb> 
<lb>in the littered pieces the clear words of truth. For</lb> 
<lb>our penitence deserves a glimplse only; our toil</lb> 
<lb>respite only.</lb> 
</p>
<p>
<lb rend="indent">The nights now are full of wind and destruction;</lb>
<lb>the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter</lb> 
<lb>skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and</lb> 
<lb>they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and</lb> 
<lb>scatter damp paths. Also the sea tosses itself and</lb> 
<lb>breaks itself, and should any sleeper fancying that</lb>  
<lb>he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts,</lb> 
<lb>a sharer of his solitude, throw off his bedclothes and</lb> 
<lb>go down by himself to walk on the sand, no image</lb> 
<lb>with semblance of serving and divne promptitude</lb>  
<lb>come readily to hand brining the night to order</lb>  
<lb>and making the world reflect the compass of the soul.</lb> 
<lb>The hand dwindles in his hand; the voice bellows in</lb> 
<lb>his ear. Almost it would appear that it is useless</lb>  
<lb>in such confusion to ask the night those questions as</lb>  
<lb>to what, and why, and wherefore, which tempt the</lb> 
<lb>sleeper from his bed to seek and answer.</lb>
