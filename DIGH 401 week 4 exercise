<?php
$a = 30;
$b = 31;
function months()
{
global $a, $b;
$a = $a + $b + $b + $b;
}
months();
function days($a)
{
global $b;
$b = $a - $b;
}
days ($a = 123);
echo $b;
?>

My rationale - I went with two variables because I got caught up in thinking about how 3 of the 4 months had the same number of days. 
If this were a different example, I would most likely have gone with separate variables for each of the months.
For whatever reason, I just could not think of how to pass through the result. Seeing it in the solution example was definitely a "duh! of course!"
moment for me.
